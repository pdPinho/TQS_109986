## Jacoco analysis
![Screenshot from 2024-02-16 10-58-19](https://github.com/pdPinho/TQS_109986/assets/125307135/72725d34-1480-4cc7-9809-fc088fb6434c)

When comparing or analysing jacoco results we should always keep in mind that test for **equals** and **hashcode** aren't necessarily needed, which can lead to "false positives".

However, when we analyse the rest, we come to face with some big problems, such as **fromArray(int[])** and **add(int)**, which could lead to conflicts even thought they are simple things.
