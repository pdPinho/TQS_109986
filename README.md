org.junit.jupiter.api.Test   <-- 5th version

Unit testing with throwables:

public static < T extends Throwable > T assertThrows(Class< T > expectedType, Executable executable)

Asserts that execution of the supplied executable throws an exception of the expectedType and returns the exception.

If no exception is thrown, or if an exception of a different type is thrown, this method will fail.
