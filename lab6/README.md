# Quality gate 
When we first set up our SonarQube with its default settings, we will have Sonar reporting that our code is clean, however it won't "fail" it with its begining state. It will only be taking action on the upcoming increments. 

# SonarQube command
If we want to void writing the port on the verify command such as
`mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=[url] -Dsonar.projectKey=[project_name] -Dsonar.token=[key]`

Then we should add Global settings to our pom file

Technical Debt - 1h 35min

In other words, we would have to spend around 1h and 35mins to fix these problems, or we can just ignore them... 
And that's how technical debt accumulates, by having the "build now, fix later" mentality.
